# Sights
Have you ever thought how your world would be if you could not see?
With darkness all around and not a thing visible around you how would you make your way through the crowds, the streets or around your neighborhood?
This is often what visually impaired people feel. Some are born this way and adapt their other senses really well but then there are some who are unfortunate and lose their vision due to an accident or a disease.
We have a solution for these special souls. With Sights you just need your phone and and internet connection to know what you are facing. Just open the app in user mode and follow the instructions.
The app tells you what the camera of your phone faces though sound output. With a unique algorithm it determines the biggest object or the object that could turn out to be most dangerous of the available objects. For example, if it detects a bike, a car and a bus. It would produce an output in this order - bus -> car -> bike.
Thus it would alert the visually impaired of impending danger.
